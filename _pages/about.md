I am a Masterâ€™s student at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) and a  Student Research Volunteer at the Biomedical Data Sciences Hub (Bio-DaSH) in the [Clinical & Translational Science Institute](https://ctsi.med.nyu.edu). Under the guidance of [Prof. Gustavo Stolovitzky](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/gustavo-a-stolovitzky) I focus on performance monitoring of AI Decision Support Tools (AI-DSTs) deployed at NYU Langone Health and NYC Health + Hospitals. 

Previously, I was a Visiting Research Fellow at the [Center for Visual Information Technology, IIIT Hyderabad](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in) advised by [Prof. C.V. Jawahar](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/?view=article&id=8&catid=24) and [Prof. Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io). My work centered on enhancing Lecture Presentation Understanding using synthetic lecture slide data.

In summer 2023, I interned at [Wells Fargo, Hyderabad, IN](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wellsfargo) where I was invloved in developing semantic-aware audio transcriptions for onboarding presentations tailored for Visually Impaired (VI) employees by fine-tuning vision-language models on proprietary datasets. The proceeds directly benefited over 15,000 VI Wells Fargo employees globally.  During my undergraduate studies at [SVNIT, Surat](https://www.svnit.ac.in), I worked under [Prof. Rupa G Mehta](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=DSN0Cw0AAAAJ&hl=en) on improving the explainability of deep learning-based thoracic disease predictors through clinical ontology integration.

Besides academics, I am a former national-level swimmer, winning accolades while representing my high-school, university, and the state of Gujarat. I have served as the Chapter Head for the [ACM Student Chapter](https://acm-website.vercel.app) in NIT Surat, and an editor at NIT Surat's official publication club, [Renesa](https://www.renesasvnit.com).
